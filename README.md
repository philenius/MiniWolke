# Mini Wolke
`Mini Wolke` is a small lamp in shape of a cloud consisting of a lampion and cotton wool. Inside, it contains an Arduino with a RGB LED ring to light up the lamp.

## How to build your own Mini Wolke
You need ...
* an Arduino (no matter which one, but I suggest an Arduino LilyPad),
* a RGB LED ring with at least 12 LEDs,
* a FTDI USB-Serial-Converter (only when you're using the LilyPad),
* a power supply at 5 V, max. 1000 mA,
* a lampion,
* glue,
* and polyfill / polyester fiberfill (german: FÃ¼llwatte).
